    <h1>Traditional industries in Tunisia</h1><br>
    <p class="hi">
      Tunisia is not only culturally rich and home to some of Hollywood's
      blockbuster locations, such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but it is also
      one of the top 15 garment suppliers in the world. With the advantage of
      being close to the European market, Tunisia is the fifth-largest supplier
      and the leading trouser supplier for the EU. The textiles and clothing
      sector in Tunisia is the largest industrial sector and is almost entirely
      export-oriented, with over 1,592 companies contributing 15% of the
      country's GDP in 2019. It is also one of Tunisia's largest employers,
      embracing over 158,000 people and contributing significantly to the
      national economy. In contrast, the leather and footwear sector is less
      developed, with only 260 enterprises, 73% of which export entirely and
      employ approximately 40,000 people. Mixed (Tunisian-foreign) ownership
      accounts for approximately 60% of all enterprises, employing 61% of the
      sector's workforce. Around 40% of all enterprises are entirely
      foreign-owned, with decisions made outside the country.

 <p class="text">Tunisia is also known for its many craft products and many of the regions of Tunisia have different specialities and trades.
  Tunisian pottery is mainly influenced by Guellala, a city behind the creation of other pottery centers on the coast of Tunisia, including Tunis, Nabeul, Moknine, etc.[80] Yellow, green or brown enamel is the trademark of Nabeul for example.[81] Shaping, baking and decoration of pottery however, remain primitive.[81]
  The ironwork in Tunisia dates back to the Andalusian era when the studded ornamental wrought iron doors become a characteristic. Blue is the tradition with the window shutters, intended to beautify the homes and preserve the privacy of residents and ward off evil spirits. The grids recall the lattices of the Arab-Andalusian tradition, and carved wood panels, which enabled women to watch the street without being seen. 
  At the beginning of the twentieth century, each region and often even each village had its own costume. Today, traditional dress is mostly reserved for only weddings and other national or native ceremonies.[82].
  Finally, Tunisia has a rich tradition of mosaics dating back to ancient times</p><br><br><br>
